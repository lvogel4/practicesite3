																	Let's say that I'm quite the newbie at using templates (or as the kids said in the olden days, n00b). Even when I was first learning web design for fun in middle school, I would say that I didn't even know that I could modify templates to my own benefit (which made me feel amateurish next to other web designers). All I can say now is thank you, Professor M., for allowing me to experiment with this template.

										<h2 class="major"><span>About Me</span></h2>
										<p>
											In terms of information about me, I would say that I'm currently a college student at GMU. I'm a transfer student previously from <b> NOVA (Northern Virginia Community College); </b> it's safe to say that my transfer was a bit complicated. Basically, I started off at the <b> NOVA in Manassas, </b> partially at the advice of my LiveJournal friends (and <i> yes, </i> LiveJournal <i> used </i> to be cool), and I think they definitely helped me make the right decision. Even though Manassas NOVA didn't work out as well as I thought, I did learn that NOVA in general was a good way to get a head start.

I ended up completing my General Studies degree at <b> Loudoun NOVA, </b> where I participated at College Steps. I can safely say <b> College Steps</b>  was one of my most productive experiences, especially given that I am neurodivergent (autism spectrum, anxiety, and OCD, or obsessive compulsive disorder) and the peer mentors and teachers alike did a good job in terms of making me feel welcome.
I would say that in terms of the <b> autism spectrum, </b> I would fall more lightly on the spectrum -- my mother would argue that my anxiety disorder is more of a problem. As for obsessive compulsive disorder, I would say that I don't have the "washing hands" stereotype as much as intrusive thoughts, which is something that gets glossed over commonly in discussing obsessive compulsive disorder in general. It's a pity, because I think that it is important in terms of getting people with <b> OCD </b> diagnosed. I am at George Mason University, currently. I am a year away from graduating and getting my Bachelor's Degree, which I am proud of. In terms of my graduation, I would have graduated earlier if not for a genuinely horrific class that made me have to repeat the idea of math, Groundhog Day-style. I should say that it is fortunate that I got out when I did and transferred to CollegeSteps. I highly recommend CollegeSteps as a good college alternative for people on the autistic spectrum.

<h3> Skills and Experiences </h3><br>
</br>

<p> If one was to ask what one of my greatest strengths is, I would say it is my writing ability and my verbal ability. From the age of four, I was writing -- rather childish stories, what you'd expect from a four year old, but it's still prominent. In addition, I have become skilled at video editing, art, photography, and critical analysis (albeit critical analysis I've done in my free time). Math has never been one of my strong suits, but I think thanks to a particularly good teacher at College Steps, I became good at it. I am also good at picking up on new skills quickly.
In terms of my experiences, I unfortunately have not had many writing-related internships or volunteer jobs. I have, however, had volunteer experience before, namely volunteering at the organization Earth Sangha in order to help out with plants and taking care of them. In addition, I currently volunteer at a library where my job typically involves finding missing books as well as doing the occasional mark-outs (in other words, marking which books can't be used by the library anymore), folding papers, and more. I would say that it is a quite rewarding experience, especially given my supportive boss and co-workers, as well as having the opportunity to be around books. (Always a plus!) </p>

<h3> More About Me </h3> <br>
</br>

In terms of the career I've been looking for, it mostly involves one day becoming a <b> writer. </b> A <b> published author, </b> more specifically. From the beginning, I have always been fascinated with works of fiction that I've loved and <b> have a desire to create my own. </b> I have currently been into <b> fanfiction </b> since I was eleven years old (at the suggestion of my eye doctor, apparently, who had a daughter around my age into the very medium), but I have a desire to branch out into <b> original fiction </b> for myself. My influences have been media such as <b> Star Wars; </b> I hope one day to create a space opera that people will appreciate.
